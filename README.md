## Overview

The goal of this lab is to start building the skills to transform data using the `dplyr` package in R ([dplyr reference page](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html)). Students will also continue to develop the knowledge and skills needed to effectively access and utilize R documentation.

## Instructions

After creating your own github repository and connecting it to your RStudio, you should work through the exercises provided in `L02_transformations.html`. A template is also provided (rename as lastname_firstname_L02.qmd).

You will only need to submit the rendered html file which **must contain a link to your github repo**. Including the github repo link provides all the support materials needed to reproduce your work, an essential feature of quality scientific work, especially data science/analysis work. See canvas for submission details.
